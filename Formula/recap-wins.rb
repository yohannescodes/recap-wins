# Homebrew formula for recap-wins.
#
# This repo doubles as its own tap:
#   brew tap yohannescodes/recap-wins https://github.com/yohannescodes/recap-wins
#   brew install recap-wins
#
# The formula builds from the source tarball of a tagged release. When cutting a
# new version, bump `url` to the new tag and update `sha256` (see scripts/release.sh,
# which prints both). The installed binary is `rw`.
